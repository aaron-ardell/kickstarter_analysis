# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze the outcome of Kickstarter campaigns based on their launch dates and funding goals. The client is looking for comparisons to the outcome of their crowdfunded theatrical play.

## Analysis and Challenges





### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The dataset contains 4,114 individual crowdfunded campaigns including project names, descriptions, funding goals, pledged amounts, outcomes, countries of origin, currencies, launch dates, backers as well as categories and subcategories. For the purposes of this analysis, we limited the data to the 1,369 campaigns in the theater category to determine the most successful launch dates.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


Initially, variances and typos in the repetitive COUNTIFS formulas were throwing the Outcomes Based on Goals cells into inaccuracy. Copying and pasting verified formulas produced consistent results. As a result, another challenge in organizing the formulas were making the cell references absolute, so when I shifted the formulas from successful, failed, and canceled. Then, the formulas would continue to pull from the same data columns. Once the columns of successful, failed and canceled were ironed out, the rest of the data collection went smoothly.    

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The highest quantity of Kickstarter Campaigns were launched in the month of May. In addition, there were more successful campaigns in the month of May than any other. Campaigns launched in December were the closest to an even success and fail rate. December also had the fewest quantity of campaigns launched. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
There were two ranges of successful campaign goals that outpaced the quantity of failed campaigns: less than $1,000 to $14,999 and $35,000 to $44,999. Campaigns with goals over $45,000 had the largest increase in their failure rate.
